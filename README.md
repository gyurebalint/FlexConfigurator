# FlexConfigurator

Opening the index.html file you can see the result of this project. This is an in-house tool for my plant manager in Switzerland.

## Problem Definition
We have a flexible part in our product which we use but we don't really detail we just use a simplified representation of it, and send the parameters straight to the manufacturer.
This isn't ideal neither for us nor for the manufacturer, so it needed an automated solution which our deigners can handle. As a result we only send a
drawing to our manufacturer as we should.

## About the app
This is a basic webapp, based on some input parameters it shows the part you'll want to produce and can export it to PDF to send it to production. This is a local html document, 
running JavaScript on it. I tried to make it look as professional as I could, plus I prepared it for future data collection, for now it is not an online tool.
